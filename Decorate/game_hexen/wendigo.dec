// I remember once when I was visiting Treherne, I was staying at a motel for a
// few days to be with Dad while he had a short break from touring with his band.
// One early morning I went out on the back patio, unable to sleep, just watching
// the snow fall down on the ground.
// To this day, I still remember the sight of something moving in the forest.
// I could never make out exactly what it was, thanks to me being ungodly tired
// at the time, but I distinctly remember just seeing it made my skin crawl. It
// seemed like humanoid shape, bent over and running around like a beast in the
// woods. It was as if a guy had forgotten how to, well, be a guy and became a
// critter instead.
// Never understood what it was. Now that I'm familiar with urban legends, though,
// sounds like it could have been a wendigo. Well, assuming they actually exist,
// of course.
// Still. Never liked them. Even these guys sometimes make my mind race back
// to that memory, sending ice down my spine once again.

// I guess all of this is irrelevant, though, isn't it?
// Sorry, I just wanted to pad this page with something.
