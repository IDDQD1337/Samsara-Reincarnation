More Credits:

* The Doom 64 guy and Doom 64 is property of Midway Games and id Software.

* Puzzfail sound from Samsara pre-0.28 (old Doomguy/Ranger puzzfail sound, credits go to TerminusEst13).
* Resources and code were from a Doom 64 resource project, but I can't remember which one (most likely the Doom 64 Stuff mod from long ago, credits go to Footman and anyone else that contributed to said mod).
* Tipboxes done by TerminusEst13 (thanks!).
* New railgun stuff by the same person(s) behind Doom 64 Stuff.
* Previous railgun (horrible pre-v6 version) modified out of plasma gun sprites by tehvappy50. Feel free to laugh at how much it sucked.
* HUD graphics, hybrid sprites, and new burndeath sequence by Flynn_Taggart95 (huge thanks!).
* TerminusEst13 did not make this addon class, all questions regarding this addon should go to tehvappy50.

======== NOW COMPATIBLE WITH SAMSARA V0.28 ========
===================================================


KNOWN STUFF
- DO NOT ASK TERMINUSEST13 ABOUT THIS CLASS IT'S NOT HIS IT'S IVANDOBROVSKI'S. SEND BUG REPORTS TO THIS FAG!
- Credits mostly go to elZee for his code which I based most stuff on.
- We don't have a samsara-like hud yet, I know. I can't generate art!
- Thanks a lot to Interceptor Entertainment, especially Andrew Hulshult for his epic GDTFW remake!
	The intro song will play everytime a round begins on LMS game mode, to turn it off type "set notheme 1" to your console.
	^^^ Due to some bugs this is cancelled, the music is still in there though.
- The Slot I for Blake Stone is an ammo refill item. To get rid of the "use then pick it up again for infinite refill" bug, I used some "band aids", one thing
that I couldn't fix was the weapon state being shown as "still pickable" while in reality you can't pick it in the map if you picked it once.



CONTAINS ADDITIONAL STUFF FROM SAMSARA 0.27b SO IF SOMETHING CHANGES WITH THOSE DO NOT USE THIS WITH IT WITHOUT ASKING IVAN! (Things may break!)
