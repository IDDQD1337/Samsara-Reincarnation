* Note 1: Punchdrunk isnt made yet because im out of time.

* Note 2: Im trying to fill every missing thing, so i wish that this
		  wont feel incomplete anymore. (Please, check Note 1*)

* Note 3: I hope that this is compatible with Hexen & Strife (wew) now.  
 
* Note 4: The Eradicator addon could have a lot of better effects & visual things, but some of the required graphics 
		  were just impossible to rip.
	
* Note 5: Tipboxes for Strifeguy and Eleena will be included in the next version of this.

* Note 6: If something isnt working well, please let me know! (Any feedback will be appreciated too!)
